# ml-supervised-learning-time-series-regression
I executed a Kaggle competition "Blue Book for Bulldozers" to predict the auction sale price for heavy equipment.

* This demo was developed following the completion of the "Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp" courses: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/


## Problem Statement
The instruction from Kaggle was to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on its usage, equipment type, and configuration.


## Data
**Source of data:** The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.
* Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data


## What you should expect
The following steps were taken on the dataset to develop an ML model
* Data exploration to determine the influence of various features on the outcome or target feature
* Popular ML machines were imported into the notebook.
* The data sets were described with statistic charts including a correlation matrix
* Classification ML models were deployed including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier & SVM Classifier
* After the initial scoring, the models were scored and evaluated
* The model hyperparameters were tuned using the following measures by hand coding, using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
* The model outputs were evaluated with an ROC curve, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, etc.


## Next Steps
See the Python notebook attached to this repository for the modeling work.
